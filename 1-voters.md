## What is Approval Voting?

Approval Voting allows you to check multiple candidates on a ballot. Imagine if somebody in the current method votes for Nader *and* Bush, then their vote is discarded as an illegal "overvote" and not counted. With Approval Voting, overvotes are legal and _all votes are counted_.

Rather than "Pick One" you can "Pick Many" so that you can nominate the representatives that you feel share your values best. The candidate with the most votes across all the ballots win — just like the existing method.


## Why does the voting method matter?

The way we vote determines who we elect. We currently use "Single Choice Voting" (or "First Past the Post", if you've heard of that before) where you can only pick one candidate from a list. Because you have only one vote, you'll try hard to vote for the candidate that is _the least worst alternative_. You don't want to throw away your vote, but you've got to stop the other, worst candidate from winning, even if who you vote for is far from your ideal candidate.

This is a flawed voting method. Voters shouldn't be picking the 'least bad' candidate - they should be able to express their beliefs and hopes for an ideal representative. An ideal voting method should choose a representative that represents the shared values of the population.

Voting isn't just checking a box — voting should be a survey of what you, a constituent, believe.

But voters don't have to vote this way. We don't need to make trade-offs between terrible candidates to pick the "least worst" candidate. We can judge each candidate independently from each other, and pick the best one.

## How does Approval Voting change elections?

Approval Voting lends support to candidates that appeal to a broad base. The likely winner in an AV election is the candidate who can build coalitions, propose nuanced solutions to complex problems, and represent the community as a whole, as opposed to being the 'least bad option' in front of voters.

## Does Approval Voting allow you to vote multiple times?

No. Approval Voting doesn't violate "one person one vote." The term “one person one vote” refers to the weight of votes, not to how votes are expressed.

The U.S. Supreme Court made the “one person one vote” rule explicit in Reynolds v. Sims (377 U.S. 533). The rule stated that no vote should count more than any other so that it has unequal weight. This unequal weight would violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution. And it was Baker v. Carr (369 U.S. 186) that extended the Equal Protection Clause to districting issues. In Reynolds, the state of Alabama set up its districts so that they varied wildly in population. The districting was so bad that it gave some voters’ ballots as much as 41 times more weight than others. Because the weights of the ballots were different between districts, that violated the “one person one vote” rule.

A common misconception is that Approval Voting gives more weight to voters who vote for more candidates. To see why this isn’t the case, imagine a tied election between a liberal and two conservatives. Bob casts a vote for the liberal, while Alice casts an opposing vote for the two conservatives. After Bob and Alice have voted, the election is still tied. Bob and Alice have an opposite but equal effect on the election. Another way to think of it is that if you vote for all candidates, that has the same effect as not voting at all. The key here is that no voter has an unfair advantage. Effectively, every voter casts an “aye” or “nay” vote for every candidate.

Finally, consider that voters are already allowed to vote for multiple candidates in “at large” races. For instance, a city council may simultaneously elect three representatives. Some voters may vote for three candidates, while others may vote for only one or two candidates.

## But what about instant-runoff voting?

Our extensive analysis overwhelmingly supports that Approval Voting is a much simpler and more democratic method than IRV. The results of Approval Voting elections are also much easier to understand than the numerous rounds of vote transfers that IRV utilizes. In an Approval Voting election, you would only see approval percentages and total votes for each candidate — much simpler than IRV. See the [comparison between IRV and Approval Voting](/compare)

## FairVote says Approval Voting suffers from "Bullet Voting" -- what is it?

Fairvote defines Bullet Voting as when a voter selects only one candidate, and no others on their Approval Voting ballot. That ballot would effectively be the same as a Plruality Vote ballot. The fear is that if everyone chooses to bullet vote then none of the advantages of approval voting would occur, and we would be stuck with the same flawed system.

While a voter *can* vote for just one candidate, it is frequently in their interests to vote for voters to honestly declare their preferences. Voters who vote for more candidates are more likely to have influence on the election than those who bullet vote. 

A common example (often cited by FairVote in other contexts) is a voter who preferred Green Party candidate Ralph Nader in the 2000 USA Presidential election, but insincerely voted for Democrat Al Gore in order not to "waste her vote" under plurality voting (because the real battle was between Gore & Bush). If it had been approval voting, do you think this voter would:

1. Approve both Gore and Nader (and any other candidates that voter preferred over Gore)
1. Only approve Gore
1. Only approve Nader

Models and real world experience shows that the number of bullet votes are small. In a [French approval voting](http://scorevoting.net/FrenchStudy.html) study (thousands of voters, 16 candidates, presidential election of 2002; probably the largest approval voting study ever), ratio of ballots to votes was 1:3.15, meaning that the average ballot had had 3 to 4 acceptable candidates. The percentage of "bullet style" (approves exactly one) ballots was 11.1%.
