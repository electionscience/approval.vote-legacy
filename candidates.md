## How does Approval Voting affect me as a representative?

Approval voting, in most situations, is likely broaden your appeal, and allow you to win by a larger amount. A key feature of Approval Voting is that votes for you are independent of the other candidates running. 

For example, consider a traditional election with 49% of the vote vs an opponent with 45% of the vote. There's probably also a minority party that takes 6% of the vote.

Consider an election under approval voting:

**Under Approval Voting you can capture a much larger portion of the vote**. Instead of running on a mandate of less than half the populace, approval voting will allow you to represent the greatest number of constituents in the region. 

## Negative Campaigning is less effective under Approval Voting

Depending on what kind of candidate you are, you'll likely be very tired of negative campaigning. Nobody gets into politics for the slug fest. Ideally we would all like to run on our better principles. Because approval voting allows voters to be more honest about who they like, rather than having to vote strategically, negative campaigning works less effectively. 

Consider a slug fest between Aaron James and Barbara Fuchs, with a minority candidate of Michelle Banner (A, B, M). Aaron is constantly on the offensive, calling names and making ridculous statements about his main competitor, Barbara. Some of those blows land, and a minor conspiracy is created around Barbara's candidacy. But it also casts Aaron James in a bad light. Because voters have choice, the voters for Barbara start *also* voting for Michelle Banner as a check on Aaron James' policies and positions. While candidates can campaign negatively, it doesn't necessarily help them, as they are going against multiple candidates, rather than a traditional 1:1 campaign.

## What happens to parties under Approval Voting?

It's unlikely that the parties would significantly change, other than now being able to put forward multiple candidates that fit their platform. Parties are extremely useful for building solid campaigns, and developing talented politicians. Approval voting doesn't change that. Under Approval Voting are less likely to devolve into inter party bickering that has occurred under traditional voting.

## If constituents can vote for multiple people, how do I stand out as a candidate?

By running a great campaign! Approval voting encourages the best candidate to win by reaching out to underrepresented constituencies, and building bridges. The task turns from building the most ferverent base, to building the widest coalition of voters. In a tight race, it's your job to bring constituents out of the shadows, and have them engage in the political process. 
Because your candidacy is independent from any other candidate's platform, you are running on your own platform, rather than against anyone else's.
