    text: Approval Voting in Fargo, ND
---

# Fargo could soon be making history.

Over a year ago, a Fargo citizens' commission reached out to The Center for Election Science to help investigate the effectiveness of different alternative voting methods. After considering all the resources provided by CES, the citizens' commission determined that approval voting is the best voting method. Unfortunately, the city commission did not move forward with the recommendation.

Recognizing the need for this groundbreaking election reform, citizens of Fargo founded Reform Fargo and began a ballot initiative to implement approval voting in city-wide single-winner elections. The measure will be on the ballot this November. If approved, Fargo will be the first city in the nation to use this revolutionary voting method. This is Fargo's chance to make it into the history books.

# What is approval voting?

Approval voting allows you to vote for as many candidates as you believe in. The candidate with the most votes still wins. Do you like two out of three candidates? You can vote for both! Do you approve of only one candidate? You can vote for just that candidate! The freedom of choice is truly yours.

Approval voting gives voters the power to fully express their support for candidates, opens up the field to more third party and independent candidates, and reduces hyper-partisanship. Click here to learn more about the benefits of approval voting.

# We need you!

Every Wednesday through November we will be hosting a volunteer meetup event to plug you into an exciting volunteer role. RSVP for one of our meetings today!
