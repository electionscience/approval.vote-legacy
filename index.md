# What is Approval Voting?

Approval voting eliminates the "spoiler effect" of third party candidates. It makes voting fairer, easier, and ensures that candidates better represent their consitituents.

Imagine if the 2016 Presidential Ballot looked like this: 

<div>
<p>
<form action="">
  <input type="checkbox" name="candidate" value="Jeb Bush">Jeb Bush<br>
  <input type="checkbox" name="candidate" value="Ben Carson">Ben Carson<br>
  <input type="checkbox" name="candidate" value="Chris Christie">Chris Christie<br>
  <input type="checkbox" name="candidate" value="Ted Cruz">Ted Cruz<br>
  <input type="checkbox" name="candidate" value="Bernie Sanders">Bernie Sanders<br>
  <input type="checkbox" name="candidate" value="Carly Fiorina">Carly Fiorina<br>
  <input type="checkbox" name="candidate" value="Jim Gilmore">Jim Gilmore<br>
  <input type="checkbox" name="candidate" value="Mike Huckabee">Mike Huckabee<br>
  <input type="checkbox" name="candidate" value="John Kasich">John Kasich<br>
  <input type="checkbox" name="candidate" value="Hillary Clinton ">Hillary Clinton<br>
  <input type="checkbox" name="candidate" value="Rand Paul">Rand Paul<br>
  <input type="checkbox" name="candidate" value="Marco Rubio">Marco Rubio<br>
  <input type="checkbox" name="candidate" value="Rick Santorum">Rick Santorum<br>
  <input type="checkbox" name="candidate" value="Lincoln Chafee">Lincoln Chafee<br>
  <input type="checkbox" name="candidate" value="Jim Webb">Jim Webb<br>
  <input type="checkbox" name="candidate" value="Donald Trump">Donald Trump<br>
  <input type="checkbox" name="candidate" value="Lawrence Lessig">Lawrence Lessig<br>
  <input type="checkbox" name="candidate" value="Martin O'Malley ">Martin O'Malley<br>
  <input type="checkbox" name="candidate" value="Jill Stein">Jill Stein<br>
</form></p></div>

instead of this:
<div><p><form action="">
<input type="radio" name="candidate" value="Donald Trump">Donald Trump<br>
  <input type="radio" name="candidate" value="Hillary Clinton ">Hillary Clinton<br>
</form></p></div>

Who would you vote for?
