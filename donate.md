*Your donation makes a difference.* The Center for Election Science is dedicated to helping the world use smarter election systems. Here in the US, the Congressional approval rating is in the teens. And despite more Americans identifying as independent than either Democrat or Republican, rarely do independents ever get elected.

We provide solutions by working with organizations, government, and the public at large. Our reforms address issues such as never fearing a wasted vote, which is solved with approval voting. You deserve a meaningful vote that successfully shapes the policies you care about. There is no less at stake than democracy itself.

Thanks to your kindness and generosity, The Center for Election Science will continue to be a leader, committed to advancing the world towards a smarter democracy.

The Center for Election Science is a 501(c)3 nonprofit.
