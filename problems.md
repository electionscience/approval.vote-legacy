The way we vote determines the people we elect. 
Voting isn't just checking a box - voting should be a survey of what you, a constitutent, believe. 

The widespread system of Single Choice voting means voters must make trade offs between their values, and who will win. 

But voters don't have to vote this way. We can judge each candidate independently from each other.
